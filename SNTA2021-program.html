&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title: Analytics-Driven Networking: When the Computer becomes the Network<br>
	(<a href="/snta/2020/snta01k-monga-slides.pdf">Slides</a>), 
	(<a href="https://sdm.lbl.gov/snta/2020/snta01k-monga-1min.mp4">Summary presentation</a>),

	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract: 
	As the era of 'human-managed networking' passes to 'analytics-driven networking', more and more data about networks, including the constituent flows, is being tracked and retrieved. With networks now needing to be an effective sensor, new methods are being proposed to create and manage this streaming telemetry. While collection of this telemetry is happening at an unprecedented scale, it is unclear if the data is of enough resolution to make real-time decisions needed for fine-grained control, or for the application of new machine learning/artificial intelligence techniques. New techniques are being developed to provide high-precision telemetry as new analytics to take advantage of that are being developed. <br>
	While telemetry is being used to provide insights about networks, applications want more instrumentation from the currently opaque network. Currently, there is little ability for the applications to interact with the network to exchange information, negotiate performance parameters, discover desired performance metrics, or receive status/troubleshooting information in real time. <br>
	This talk will share challenges, opportunities and new research in progress, from a science network view, as we evolve the network to an analytics-driven, autonomous system. In addition, the talk will discuss the new nation-scale testbeds being built, with new capabilities, like in-network processing, that could revolutionize how we measure and process end-to-end workflows. 
	<br><br>
	Indermohan (Inder) S. Monga serves as the Division Director for Scientific Networking Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Lab and Executive Director of Energy Sciences Network, a high- performance network user facility optimized for large-scale science, interconnecting the National Laboratory System in the United States. Under his leadership, the organization focuses on advancing the science of networking for collaborative and distributed research applications. He contributes to ongoing research projects tackling network programmability, analytics and quality of experience driving convergence between application layer and the network. He currently holds 23 patents and has 20+ years of industry and research experience in telecommunications and data networking. His work experience in the private sector includes network engineering for Wellfleet Communications and Nortel where he focused on application and network convergence. His undergraduate degree is in electrical/electronics engineering from Indian Institute of Technology in Kanpur, India, with graduate studies from Boston University.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eric Chan-Tin, Loyola University, Chicago<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Title: 2020 Vision for Web Privacy<br>
	(<a href="/snta/2020/snta02k-Chan-Tin-slides.pdf">Slides</a>),

	<br>
	&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Abstract: 
	Privacy is getting eroded as more surveillance is happening. The history of web privacy will be discussed along with a vision for the future. This talk will discuss how web users are tracked, what can be done about it, the impact of web surveillance on society, and privacy regulations. <br>
	Web privacy has evolved significantly in the past two decades. There was no application-level encryption and snooping on what users were doing was trivial. As encryption, proxies, and other anonymity schemes start getting used, web surveillance has switched to using metadata. At the moment, achieving web privacy is similar to the arms race of virus/anti-virus. New methods to break web users' privacy are found as current vectors are patched or mitigated.<br>
	Web surveillance or invading web users' privacy can have both useful and harmful consequences. The methods can be used to identify illegal activity and ensure that users are who they say they are. However, these methods can also be used to perform censorship and track what users are doing on the web without their knowledge. The latter could be used for targeted advertising - on one hand, this means more useful advertisements, but on the other, it could mean targeted pricing.<br>
	Many people might say they have nothing to hide; this talk will show how this is such a misleading myth. The evolution and future of webbrowser fingerprinting and website fingerprinting will be discussed, along with other societal and human impacts of web privacy on the future.
